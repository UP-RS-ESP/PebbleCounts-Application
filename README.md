# PebbleCounts-Application

This is a collection of _Python_ scripts implementing some of the methods outlined in an upcoming manuscript. In this manuscript we up-scale the use of the [PebbleCounts](https://github.com/UP-RS-ESP/PebbleCounts) algorithm to large photo-surveyed channel cross sections in high mountain rivers to count grain-size distributions. The percentile uncertainty estimation is taken from recent work by Brett Eaton, published [here](https://esurf.copernicus.org/articles/7/789/2019/esurf-7-789-2019.html) and available as _R_ code [here](https://github.com/bceaton/GSDtools).
